# Library-Management-System

## Its my Project using PHP,HTML,CSS.It Doesn't use Javascript because localhost didn't load it properly.

## Steps To Run
1. Install Xampp/Wampp/Lampp etc.
2. Start the Apache server and My SQL.
3. Open https://localhost/phpmyadmin.
4. The Database name is `registration`.
5. Import the sql code in the database.
6. Copy the folder `Library` to `htdoc` folder in (C:\xampp\htdocs) Here,C: is the drive containg the OS in windows.
7. To Access the website, open https://localhost/Library
8. Students can create account,login,check all the books in database and reserve them.  
9. Admin can login,add books,edit books,delete books and remove from reserved list
10. Email and Password both are `admin`


## Limitation: You can only add one book of the same name,There is no user friendly form validation and no responsiveness 



# If it says file is not in the server or incorrect path,change `library/index.php` to `Library/index.php`.
